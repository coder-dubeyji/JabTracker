        <h3><strong>Description:</strong></h3>
        <p>The COVID-19 vaccine helps protect against the coronavirus infection, which can cause mild to severe respiratory illness. It builds immunity, reduces the risk of serious complications, and helps prevent the spread of the virus. Vaccines such as Covishield, Covaxin, and Pfizer are commonly administered in multiple doses including boosters. It played a major role in controlling the global pandemic and saved millions of lives. Most vaccines are mRNA or vector-based and work by teaching your body to fight the virus. It is now considered essential for global travel and for protection in crowded public settings.</p>

        <h3><strong>Side Effects:</strong></h3>
        <p>Common side effects include mild fever, fatigue, headache, and soreness at the injection site. Some people may also experience chills, muscle aches, or drowsiness within 24â€“48 hours of vaccination. Redness and swelling at the injection area is normal. Rarely, people have reported nausea or temporary joint pain. In very rare cases, allergic reactions may occur, especially in people with a history of allergies. Most side effects are signs of your immune system building protection and go away in a couple of days.</p>

        <p>The Hepatitis B vaccine prevents infection caused by the hepatitis B virus, which affects the liver. It is part of routine immunization and protects against chronic liver disease and liver cancer. Administered in 3 doses, it offers strong immunity when taken as recommended. Newborns often receive the first dose within 24 hours of birth. It is especially crucial for healthcare workers and individuals in contact with blood or body fluids. This vaccine has helped reduce Hepatitis B prevalence worldwide.</p>

        <h3><strong>Description:</strong></h3>
        <p>The polio vaccine protects against poliomyelitis, a disease that can cause irreversible paralysis. There are two types: OPV (oral drops) and IPV (injection). Itâ€™s part of the routine childhood immunization schedule. OPV is easy to administer and widely used in mass campaigns. IPV is safer in areas with low polio risk. Eradication efforts have made the vaccine crucial in global health. Multiple doses are required for full protection during infancy and childhood.</p>

        <h3><strong>Side Effects:</strong></h3>
        <p>The oral polio vaccine rarely causes side effects but may lead to minor stomach upset. IPV may result in slight swelling or redness at the injection site.

        <h3><strong>Care Tips:</strong></h3>
        <p>Let the child rest after vaccination and avoid long outings. Maintain hygiene especially for OPV to avoid spreading live virus. Keep a watch for any weakness in limbs post-vaccine, though extremely rare. Encourage fluid intake and comfort if there's mild fever. Follow up with the next scheduled dose without missing it. Contact your doctor if you observe any concerning symptoms.</p>
